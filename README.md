### Data Wrangling and Analysis Project


### 
In this project, students were asked to programmatically download data in the form of JSON files from the WeRateDogs Twitter account.  We were also given a csv file and another TSV file was programmatically downloaded.  Data was wrangled to make it usable for analysis and the clean tables were used to gain insights into the WeRateDogs account.
